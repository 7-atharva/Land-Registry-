Blockchain Project 

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
- **Lack of Transparency & Security:** Traditional land records are vulnerable to fraud, forgery, and unauthorized changes.  
- **Ownership Disputes:** Manual record-keeping leads to multiple claims on the same land.  
- **Inefficient Processes:** Paper-based systems are slow, costly, and require intermediaries.  
- **Need for a Trustless System:** A decentralized approach ensures secure and verifiable land ownership.  
- **Data Inconsistency:** Different government departments often have conflicting records, causing legal issues.  

âœ¨ Key Features  
- **Blockchain-Based System:** Ensures tamper-proof and transparent land records.  
- **Smart Contracts:** Automates land transfers and ownership verification.  
- **Decentralized Storage:** Eliminates single points of failure and unauthorized modifications.  
- **Secure Identity Verification:** Uses cryptographic methods to validate ownership.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and efficient platform for users to access and manage land records.
